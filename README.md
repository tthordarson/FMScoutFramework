# FMScoutFramework  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThanosSiopoudis/FMScoutFramework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ThanosSiopoudis/FMScoutFramework)

FMScoutFramework is a C#.NET/Mono Framework that enables you to create your own assistant tools / editors for Football Manager. It supports both FM2014 and FM2015

## Project Setup

Clone the project in your favourite github client
You will need [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com) if you develop your application for all platforms (Windows, OS X, Linux) or Microsoft Visual Studio if you develop just for windows. The client requirements will be the Mono framework for apps developed in MonoDevelop, or the .NET Framework for Visual Studio apps.

### Monodevelop Settings
1. Create your new MonoDevelop Solution
2. You can clone this repository and add it as a submodule in your own git tree, or just checkout the latest.
3. Add the FMScoutFramework project to your solution.
4. Expand your own project, and right click on `References`
5. Select `Edit References`
6. Click the `Projects` tab and tick the checkbox next to `FMScoutFramework`
7. Click `OK`
8. Right click on the `FMScoutFramework` Project
9. Click on `Options`
10. Select `Compiler` from the Menu
11. In the `Define Symbols` entry, enter `MAC` for OS X, `LINUX` for Linux or `WINDOWS` for windows.
12. You are now ready to start developing your app. Look further down for code

### Microsoft Visual Studio Settings
1. Create your new Visual Studio Solution
2. You can clone this repository and add it as a submodule in your own git tree, or just checkout the latest.
3. Add the FMScoutFramework project to your solution.
4. Expand your own project and right click on `References`
5. Click `Add Reference`
6. Click the `Projects` tab, under `Solution` and tick the checkbox next to `FMScoutFramework`
7. Click `OK`
8. Right click on the `FMScoutFramework` Project
9. Click on `Properties`
10. Select `Build` from the menu on the left
11. In the `Conditional Compilation Symbols` textbox, enter `WINDOWS;`
12. You are now ready to start developing your app. Look further down for code

##### Example Code

The following code is an example for a simple Windows Forms application and another for Mono
First, include the necessary framework headers:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using FMScoutFramework.Core;
using FMScoutFramework.Core.Entities.InGame;
```

In your class, create a new public variable:
```csharp
public FMCore fmCore = new FMCore (FMScoutFramework.Core.Entities.DatabaseModeEnum.Realtime);
```

First, create a new method that will be asynchronously called by the framework when loading is finished:
```csharp
public void GameLoaded() {
  Debug.WriteLine("Loading Finished");
}
```

Then, in your action callback method (from a button, or a menu for example) use the following code:
```csharp
fmcore.GameLoaded += new Action(GameLoaded);
new Action(() => fmCore.LoadData()).BeginInvoke((s) => { }, null);
```

That's it! You can now query the data, with simple Linq queries! Amazing, eh? Here's an example, to look for "Bar":
```csharp
var clubs = (from c in fmCore.Clubs
				     where c.Name.Contains ("Bar")
			       select c).Take (100).ToList ();
```

## Currently pending
* Add/Verify entity offsets for 15.3.2 Windows
* Add support for 15.3.2 Mac
* Add support for 15.3.2 Linux
* Add a bunch of properties for the entities already implemented
* Add a LOT of entities and properties for objects we have their main addresses for (look in 15.3.2 Windows version file)

## Contributing changes
We need more devs and support! Imagine all the tools you could create for FM2014/FM2015/FM2016(??) if everything was already implemented!
* Fork the project, make/test your changes and send a Pull Request!
* Alternatively, bug reporting is vital! Use the Github's Issues page to do that!
